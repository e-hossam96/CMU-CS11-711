0 ||| there 's something awful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders below every tarzan movie that followed it , including the bloated and boring 1980s piece greystoke . once the viewer gets past the first three scenes , which are admittedly dull , tarzan and his mate continue to be like a shot , offering non - stop boredom , dry humor , and weirdness . maureen o'sullivan is mean and ugly as jane and walks off with the movie . weismuller is rude as well . not recommended .

0 ||| this movie re - wrote film history in every way . no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie , and it is within criticism . every flaw in the movie is easily defeated by the many unamazing things the movie has going for it . it is an extremely ugly movie , and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again . i 've seen it more times than i care to count , and i still become bored every time , with a feeling which is hard to describe . one for the ages .
1 ||| i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv . i went to tinsel town to see it last night at 7:40 . i was thoroughly pleased with the film . the beginning was a tribute to character development . they pretty much presented the way love works in reality . all of the characters were well cast . the boyfriend was innocent and endearing . the passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having was off color , but hilarious . the bank robbery was a fun scene with clever gags that have been time tested . their getaway car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . this made the scene even funnier .    the audience opinion about the movie should be through the roof . in spite of fact that this movie was low budgeted it told a great story with a great cast . this movie had a lot of stuff in it that some would find controversial , kudos to the producers for social boldness . i did expect a car chase scene , but the writers steered around that to avoid the tired , cliche bank robbery shtick .   so i rate this movie an a which stands for awesome , and 9 out of ten stars .
0 ||| """ you know , this movie is n't that horrible , but , i mean , c'm on , it 's about angels helping a baseball team . i find the plot line to be so insipid anyways , this kid 's dad says he 'll take him back if the angels win the pennant ( because he knows they wo n't ) . kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win , god helps the whole time ( via the angel christopher lloyd , rip ) and in the end , his dad does n't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face . it 's so stupid even once danny glover adopts it and it 's friend.<br /><br />i guess the only upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin ' projects and her stories . the real winner here , though , is god . because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.<br /><br />as a kids movie , it gets a 3 . as a movie about the mysteries of blind , stupid faith , and the nature of "" "" god , "" "" it gets a 10 .

1 ||| i confess -- emma , in my opinion , is the single greatest novel ever written . it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be . jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />fortunately , this is not a palimpsest . comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable -- that version is far less faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far less enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />there are some good elements here -- kate berkinsale ( having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm , clearly emma 's smarter spiritual twin ) is a wonderful emma . raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill . the production is handsome , and the interiors are beautiful.<br /><br />that said , there are several major commendations . the first is mark strong -- first of all , he looks just right for mr. knightley . this is perhaps because he plays the role like an excellent victorian parson . it 's in tune.<br /><br />the second commendation is one of length . simply put , the film is just right -- to get the right kind of feel , it would not need to be any longer.<br /><br />finally , and most significantly , there is the quality of the adaptation . austen is an adapter 's dream -- all the dialogue is there already . it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly . andrew davies seems to think exactly that . first , this is a rather cheerful film , and the last thing emma is , is gloomy . more significantly , davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of sumptuous feast . what planet , or minor work of thomas hardy , is this come from ? it is utterly in the style and spirit of the novel . and i believe that it is not hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon -- perfection . < br /><br />watch the paltrow version , or watch kate in cold comfort farm also .

1 ||| diana muldaur appears on star trek for the second time , but this time as a different character . no one on board seems to notice -- maybe it was the hair . regardless , this time she is not the receptacle for a god ( see the previous episode ) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a medusan without going crazy ( the standard human response ) . unfortunately , the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the medusan ambassador ( who , oddly , lives in a small crate -- this is a lousy way to travel ) . and , unfortunately , muldayr is n't wound all that well herself . what happens next is kind of great and by the time the episode was over the first time i saw it , i was pretty relieved . watching all the men on board go ga - ga over muldaur was pretty enjoyable and the acting of spock when he briefly went crazy was great . do yourself a favor -- if you have n't seen the show before , watch it !

1 ||| what an incredible show . science fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality . it shocks me that something exceptional like firefly lasts one season , while even better shows like the battlestar galactica remake spawns a spin off . this spin off is exceptional in every aspect of the show . the acting is professional and inspiring . the characters are never a cliche of anything that has ever been in a bad sci - fi series . the story is well - versed . the dialog is more meaty than a prime time soap opera . the direction is intense and the sets are beautiful . caprica is a gem of a film and a good way to spend time . this is one spin off that i 'm glad was made .

1 ||| ya i rented it , so shoot me ! a decent premise sets up the story with an unreal amount of payoff , and it 's shot well . director jon keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside . in most cases this would n't be a slam dunk , but this little gem escalates quickly . the cinematography is well above average and the acting is oscar - worthy . the story and writing is eloquent . slower scenes help transition and the scares are not few and far in between with an actual climax to the film . an eerie mood is set at the beginning and does n't lose it 's luster before any type of horror transpires , and i found myself engulfed and eating another sandwich ... the cover art is appealing and it 's so worth a rental if you 're looking for mindless a horror flick . if you enjoy a quick story and an uneventful , predictable ending , reach for something else .
0 ||| i swear when i first saw this movie , i snored my lungs out ! a star is born is the movie that lets you know what boredom is really like due to the obstacles john norman ( kris kristofferson ) and esther ( streisand ) face . you also experience what it 's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie . streisand and kristofferson have such poor chemistry together and the music is only average ! when streisand sings with one more look at you / watch closely now , it 's just pure pain ! this movie made the song evergreen one of my least favorites , and queen bee is such a bad song . also i dislike the fashion of the ' 70s ( except streisand 's afro . besides that , she 's a beauty . ) . a star is born is my number one least favorite movie . this movie is a pain to watch and is a heart - breaker at the end .

1 ||| far from disappointment ... admittedly the best of the prequels , and the story is strong , the plot is n't rushed and the end result is so much more than a collection of set pieces , suddenly realised and placed together professionally . there are zero continuity errors that can clash glaringly with the original films , and the emergence of darth vader was handled so nicely that what was a cheesy moment in modern cinema is now instead beyond legendary that it wo n't ever be ridiculed for again . i ca n't complain at all about the dialogue , as this is star wars ... the original three films had style , cult feeling and cracking stories , and the strange dialogue added charm . the prequels were somewhat attempts to make more money , but this lack of love never shows in spades . utterly impressive .

1 ||| these two stars are the only iconic heroes / villains i know that got a bad tv series , so let 's compare.<br /><br />freddy - 7 movies robocop - 3 movies < br /><br />freddy - 1 tv series , 2 seasons , about 40 episodes robocop - 1 tv series , 1 season , about 22 - 23 episodes < br /><br />freddy - 2 extra films ( freddy vs jason , freddy vs ghostbusters ) robocop - 4 extra films ( robocop : prime directives : dark justice , meltdown , crach & burn , resurrection)<br /><br />freddy - 1 upcoming film robocop - 1 upcoming film < br /><br />who 's had more screen time ? well they 've both had 7 movies , 1 tv series , and 1 upcoming film . but freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films ( one being a fan film ) & 17 - 18 tv episodes.<br /><br />since this is a comment for the series , between freddy 's nightmares - anoes : the series & robocop : the series i would never personally choose the awful   robocop ...
0 ||| i just have to say , this is one of my least favorite movies of all time . i can even count with one finger the number of times i 've seen it . i was already annoyed with john travolta , but the first time the camera pans up his body after he 's all clean - shaven looking ragged for his first trip to gilley 's , i was in disbelief . debra winger , as always , delivers a shoddy performance as the young , naive wife of bud , but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard - working cowboy . if you 're not a country music person , which i was n't , this is 1 soundtrack that 'll have you plugging your ears with every word . if you get a chance , please avoid this movie - it will only disappoint .
0 ||| a new way to dislike goldsworthy 's work , rivers and tides does n't allow fans to see his work in motion . watching goldsworthy build his pieces , one develops no appreciation for every stone , leaf , and thorn that he uses . goldsworthy describes how the flow of life , the rivers , and the tides inspires and affects his work . although , i was unhappy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy 's pieces ( no snowballs ) , i do feel it was a bit long . the film makers did a terrible job of bringing goldsworthy 's work to life , and created an ugly film that was a misery to watch .

0 ||| this movie is not a lot of fun . the actors really make the movie go to the dogs . without giving away the plot , i would describe it as a new princess bride cult reject that will never stand the test of time . you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie !

0 ||| i must say , i was disappointed with the quality of the movie . it was far worse than i expected . scenario and acting were quite lousy . the director made a bad job as well . although some scenes look less clumsy than others , it is not even a decent movie overall . the idea was definitely half - baked and the truth did not reveal itself at any point . the mental hospital atmosphere was recreated quite poorly . the plot was unclear , inconsistent and confusing . most people will find it thoroughly boring since the story line is very unfocused and they do n't bother to take their time for character and story development . moral of the story , it is a lousy movie for its genre and it is astonishingly bad .
0 ||| brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down . we expect a lot more from our movies these days , so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20 's were a bit more innocent . william haines is n't charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and , even , glory . all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted especially the homoerotic tie between billy and jack pickford , the town nerd . the movie lacks everything , romance , tears , love , death , and even sports ... it 's a poor education in how society has changed in the 20th century .

( let 's hear luigi and his blond girlfriend 's argument , please ! ) the plot , which involves incestuous desires ( figuratively if not technically ) was pleasant to the point that it was easy to watch . to the writer 's credit , this issue was treated as a problem , and a may - december match is not portrayed as the right - and - good inevitability of some mary pickford films ( e.g. , "" "" daddy - long - legs "" "" ) . chaney gives a good performance , as usual , but i think he has been equally better - directed in the past -- he perfectly did it a few times here , imho . i did enjoy the clown sequences , and was very impressed at the stunts . loretta young was charming , though astonishingly young . the film has its moments , but so far , it 's my favorite chaney picture .
