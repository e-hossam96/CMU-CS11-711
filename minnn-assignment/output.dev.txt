1 ||| -lrb- t -rrb- here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , UNK , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
3 ||| it 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .
1 ||| the UNK tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo .
3 ||| i got a UNK watching this meaningless downer .
3 ||| apart from dazzling cinematography , we 've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other .
3 ||| too much of the humor falls flat .
3 ||| UNK is ultimately a pointless endeavor .
1 ||| van wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent UNK like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers .
1 ||| the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
3 ||| very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant UNK ' UNK in `` stuart little 2 `` : there 's just no story , folks .
1 ||| the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous -lrb- but with bears , and a UNK rating -rrb- , with an excruciating UNK of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
3 ||| no way i can believe this load of junk .
3 ||| `` roger michell -lrb- '' notting hill `` -rrb- directs a morality thriller . ''
3 ||| it 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary .
3 ||| there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .
3 ||| just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
1 ||| the movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly UNK UNK in your stomach .
1 ||| but is that UNK from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic UNK ?
1 ||| even with a green UNK and a UNK of UNK flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting .
3 ||| and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea .
1 ||| there 's just no UNK in UNK james bond for being a clichéd , UNK , UNK boy 's club .
3 ||| when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own UNK for a while .
1 ||| full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
3 ||| the film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
3 ||| the UNK UNK for days - this just felt like it did .
3 ||| it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as UNK at an UNK UNK for 93 minutes .
3 ||| this movie is maddening .
3 ||| it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is UNK overwrought .
3 ||| should have been someone else -
3 ||| the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels UNK , as if the real story starts just around the corner .
3 ||| why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?
1 ||| would n't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc. , be more valuable ?
3 ||| the lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it .
1 ||| rarely has UNK looked so shimmering and UNK .
1 ||| ... is an UNK attempt at directing by UNK khouri .
3 ||| i had to look away - this was god awful .
3 ||| even in this UNK kingdom , reese rules .
1 ||| velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a UNK , UNK concept on the american filmmaking scene .
3 ||| just one bad idea after another .
3 ||| because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .
1 ||| though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
3 ||| a movie that UNK somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
1 ||| corpus UNK -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about UNK minutes in .
3 ||| the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
1 ||| it 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british UNK UNK desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
3 ||| a by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .
1 ||| involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
3 ||| overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a UNK to play it on the tube .
3 ||| it 's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful UNK remake .
3 ||| it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
3 ||| despite all evidence to the UNK , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that UNK full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and UNK adults .
3 ||| an UNK awful study in self - and UNK .
3 ||| this movie is something of an impostor itself , UNK and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
3 ||| hey arnold !
3 ||| the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .
3 ||| this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
3 ||| UNK , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and UNK characters .
3 ||| once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
3 ||| a working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no UNK UNK and no liberal cause UNK .
3 ||| if the movie succeeds in UNK a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
3 ||| there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part UNK doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
1 ||| it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , UNK levy , and reginald UNK all in the same movie .
3 ||| we have n't seen such hilarity since say it is n't so !
3 ||| expect the UNK , UNK slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
3 ||| the cold turkey would 've been a far better title .
3 ||| the idea of UNK roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough .
1 ||| the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , UNK and UNK in borders on the grotesque .
1 ||| the UNK airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate UNK .
3 ||| zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .
3 ||| try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group UNK UNK , ` thank you ! '
3 ||| when leguizamo finally UNK an irritating character late in the movie .
1 ||| while it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been UNK into tedium , yu 's cinematic UNK produces nearly as much lead as gold .
3 ||| it treats women like idiots .
3 ||| though catch me if you can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
3 ||| just an average comedic UNK but not a waste of time .
3 ||| a UNK kiddie paean to pro basketball UNK by the nba .
1 ||| impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .
3 ||| for UNK , the story is just too slim .
3 ||| so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
3 ||| the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the UNK of UNK one through this movie is not .
1 ||| the film takes the UNK of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .
3 ||| it has its moments of UNK camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
3 ||| almost gags on its own gore .
3 ||| how do you spell cliché ?
3 ||| it 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a UNK show .
1 ||| the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and UNK 's home video of their baby 's UNK .
1 ||| while -lrb- hill -rrb- has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless UNK film .
1 ||| too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
3 ||| under 15 ?
3 ||| a giggle a minute .
3 ||| over age 15 ?
3 ||| big fat waste of time .
3 ||| hey arnold !
1 ||| the movie is what happens when you blow up small UNK to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
3 ||| sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
1 ||| this is not the undisputed worst UNK movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
1 ||| you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
1 ||| in the end , we are left with something like two UNK passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
3 ||| chokes on its own depiction of UNK UNK .
1 ||| UNK unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
3 ||| i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i UNK my way through clockstoppers .
1 ||| while much of the cast has charm -- especially UNK and UNK -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
3 ||| this directorial debut from music video UNK UNK is all flash .
3 ||| yes , ballistic is silly .
1 ||| unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
3 ||| the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising UNK .
3 ||| the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
1 ||| while it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -lrb- sugar hill gang , etc. -rrb- , the constant UNK of hip-hop UNK can alienate even the UNK audiences .
3 ||| not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
1 ||| care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the UNK found by his characters .
3 ||| forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
1 ||| does little more than play an innocuous game of UNK - UNK with a tragic past .
1 ||| k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .
3 ||| has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to UNK through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes UNK to break the audience 's awkward silence
3 ||| a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
3 ||| UNK 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting UNK is exhausting .
1 ||| uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
3 ||| the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
3 ||| the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .
3 ||| confirms the nagging UNK that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .
1 ||| made with no discernible craft and UNK sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
1 ||| it 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
1 ||| holden UNK did it better .
3 ||| a UNK of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
3 ||| oh come on .
1 ||| like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
3 ||| if it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .
3 ||| simplistic UNK of whimsy .
1 ||| not exactly the bees knees
3 ||| it does nothing new with the old story , except to show UNK in this sort of UNK slow motion that makes the gang UNK look like they 're being streamed over a UNK modem .
1 ||| the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
3 ||| makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
3 ||| the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey 's saturday night UNK UNK rises above the level of embarrassment .
1 ||| jacquot 's rendering of UNK 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
3 ||| in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
1 ||| chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .
3 ||| it 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in UNK but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been UNK and released now , when it has become even UNK .
3 ||| this is nothing but familiar territory .
3 ||| in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space .
3 ||| one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
3 ||| a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .
3 ||| too slow , too long and too little happens .
3 ||| the film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of UNK ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
1 ||| it 's just filler .
1 ||| sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival UNK with its UNK stance .
1 ||| utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni 's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
3 ||| a UNK romantic comedy that makes our girl the UNK UNK of an extended cheap shot across the UNK line .
3 ||| scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
3 ||| it 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
3 ||| they takes a long time to get to its UNK ending .
3 ||| barely gets off the ground .
1 ||| even on those rare UNK when the narrator stops UNK , miller 's hand often feels unsure .
1 ||| pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on UNK life , but its ambitions far UNK the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his UNK , tony r. UNK , in their feature debut .
3 ||| at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s .
1 ||| at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
3 ||| from the opening scenes , it 's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
3 ||| it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
3 ||| on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura 's best work since the UNK .
3 ||| despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -lrb- even , at times , preposterous -rrb- turns , love is just too , too precious in the end .
3 ||| a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -lrb- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -rrb- .
1 ||| by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .
3 ||| too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are UNK back in repugnance .
1 ||| UNK without the UNK satiric humor .
3 ||| manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
3 ||| do not see this film .
3 ||| minority report is exactly what the title UNK , a report .
3 ||| delivers the same old same old , UNK up with latin UNK and turned out by hollywood UNK .
3 ||| if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on UNK UNK stock that will double in value a week from friday .
1 ||| to call the other side of heaven `` appalling '' would be to UNK just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
3 ||| in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i 'd been sitting naked on an UNK , formula 51 UNK from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
3 ||| if only the story about a UNK dollar con bothered to include the con .
3 ||| i 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
3 ||| without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
1 ||| it 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special UNK in one place , minus those daytime UNK ' slickness and sophistication -lrb- and who knew they even had any ? -rrb- .
1 ||| while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
3 ||| for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , UNK dysfunctional families for the price of one .
3 ||| to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being UNK and UNK for a new generation .
3 ||| what the director ca n't do is make either of UNK kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .
1 ||| in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it UNK by just being wishy-washy .
3 ||| it 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that UNK cheese and UNK UNK played a crucial role .
3 ||| UNK williams is so funny in drag he should consider UNK UNK .
3 ||| ... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
3 ||| it 's not that kung pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk 's impish UNK .
3 ||| a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal UNK and UNK construction .
3 ||| not an UNK or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
1 ||| a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its UNK there would be precious little left .
1 ||| once -lrb- kim -rrb- begins to UNK the shock tactics and UNK metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
3 ||| the words , ` frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
3 ||| what 's next : `` my mother the car ? ''
3 ||| all the UNK tony UNK stunts and UNK UNK ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .
3 ||| a sequel that 's much too big for its UNK .
1 ||| so unremittingly awful that UNK it a dog probably UNK cruelty to UNK .
3 ||| what was once original has been UNK so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
3 ||| a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .
1 ||| for all the UNK and UNK , tears , rage and UNK UNK , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's UNK .
1 ||| a coarse and stupid gross-out .
1 ||| a nightmare date with a UNK wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper UNK platitudes .
1 ||| does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
3 ||| there 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like UNK , to go the conservative route .
3 ||| it 's one UNK world when even UNK UNK around group therapy sessions .
3 ||| the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic UNK can also seem tedious .
3 ||| but the power of these -lrb- subjects -rrb- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a UNK camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public UNK , rather than UNK to a film 's narrative .
3 ||| rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
3 ||| tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
3 ||| paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma 's scarface .
3 ||| that 's a cheat .
1 ||| harrison 's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
3 ||| this UNK is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was UNK against .
1 ||| a string of UNK sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
1 ||| the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter 's ghosts of mars , with UNK not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
1 ||| basically a static series of UNK -lrb- and UNK -rrb- UNK between the stars .
1 ||| too restrained to be a UNK show , too UNK and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... the UNK defies an easy UNK .
1 ||| an unpredictable blend of UNK smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director john mckay can swallow .
3 ||| it 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is UNK , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all UNK and the odds against success are long enough to UNK , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
3 ||| `` the time machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
3 ||| it does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
3 ||| ... a hollow joke told by a cinematic UNK having too much fun UNK the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .
3 ||| a morose little soap opera about three vapid , UNK people who take turns UNK each other .
3 ||| it 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` can this marriage be saved ? ''
1 ||| UNK from ladies home UNK ...
3 ||| the film 's essentially over by the UNK .
3 ||| i 'm sure if you 're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... me , i did n't care for it .
3 ||| it 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
1 ||| UNK motions for UNK .
3 ||| the script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman -lrb- the actor -rrb- can make it work .
1 ||| walter hill 's pulpy , stylized UNK melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable UNK UNK with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
3 ||| it has all the excitement of eating UNK .
3 ||| it 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
3 ||| although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an UNK of hackneyed dialogue and more silly UNK business than you can shake a UNK limb at .
3 ||| i 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
3 ||| star trek : nemesis UNK goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before .
1 ||| UNK dialogue , UNK costumes , UNK makeup by silly UNK and UNK UNK effects all UNK to test UNK loyalty .
3 ||| like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless UNK -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
1 ||| i do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .
1 ||| its well of UNK and UNK -lrb- and simple humanity -rrb- has long been UNK by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .
1 ||| for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of UNK UNK , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .
3 ||| do n't be UNK by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk .
3 ||| not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
3 ||| the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further UNK the conversation .
1 ||| plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread .
1 ||| a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug .
3 ||| this movie seems to have been written using UNK .
3 ||| there can be no other explanation .
3 ||| hilariously inept and ridiculous .
1 ||| vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he UNK over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
3 ||| -lrb- a -rrb- shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .
1 ||| feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
3 ||| given how heavy-handed and UNK it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done .
3 ||| a by-the-numbers UNK pic that covers all the usual ground
3 ||| a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .
1 ||| stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand UNK but stands UNK of nothing more than petty UNK of your time .
3 ||| pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .
1 ||| for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , UNK convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a UNK .
1 ||| with the exception of some fleetingly amusing UNK by UNK the UNK as perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .
3 ||| it 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .
3 ||| movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .
3 ||| -lrb- director -rrb- o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
3 ||| the intent is almost exactly the same -lrb- as the full monty -rrb- .
3 ||| all that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
3 ||| no one but a UNK guilty of some truly UNK crime should have to sit through the master of disguise .
1 ||| even the finest UNK ca n't make a UNK into anything more than a UNK , and robert de niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
1 ||| there 's too much UNK to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth UNK into a dull , ridiculous attempt at UNK .
3 ||| it 's not without its pleasures , but i 'll stick with the tune .
1 ||| miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are UNK to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his UNK affectation of seriousness .
3 ||| despite the evocative aesthetics UNK the hollow state of modern love life , the film never UNK beyond a monotonous whine .
3 ||| more maudlin than sharp .
1 ||| this is an UNK endeavor from the daughter of horror director UNK argento -lrb- a producer here -rrb- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
3 ||| it 's slow -- very , very slow .
3 ||| it 's not the ultimate UNK gangster movie .
3 ||| that 's pure UNK hype .
3 ||| characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs .
1 ||| comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the UNK UNK .
3 ||| visually rather stunning , but ultimately a UNK bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely UNK it .
1 ||| stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros. -- peter and UNK -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green 's half-hearted movie career .
3 ||| there seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .
1 ||| if you 're a UNK fan , or you UNK to the people who watched the robots getting UNK in UNK , you 'll probably like rollerball .
3 ||| i do n't think i laughed out loud once .
3 ||| and when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .
1 ||| it 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic UNK on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .
1 ||| slapstick UNK can UNK many a UNK 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
3 ||| ... turns so UNK trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a UNK sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
1 ||| the notion that UNK UNK is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this UNK unfunny comedy .
3 ||| my reaction in a word : disappointment .
1 ||| his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
3 ||| it kinda works and UNK as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
1 ||| sustains its dreamlike UNK through a succession of cheesy UNK and UNK cheap effects , not the least of which is UNK UNK .
1 ||| intriguing documentary which is emotionally UNK by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .
1 ||| feels haphazard , as if the writers UNK thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply UNK in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
1 ||| for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly UNK tara reid , whose acting skills are UNK to a cardboard UNK .
3 ||| i 've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .
3 ||| the vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = do n't have an affair with a UNK ; unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .
1 ||| a workshop UNK prevails .
1 ||| it can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
3 ||| yes , dull .
1 ||| pumpkin wants to have it both ways .
1 ||| director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .
1 ||| -lrb- w -rrb- UNK long on amiable monkeys and worthy UNK , jane goodall 's wild UNK is short on the thrills the UNK medium demands .
1 ||| outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
1 ||| this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre UNK .
3 ||| an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .
1 ||| a bloated UNK thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan UNK of self-importance ...
3 ||| it 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
1 ||| as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms. redgrave 's UNK efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
3 ||| new best friend 's UNK presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
3 ||| the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
3 ||| scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , UNK , UNK more like driving miss UNK than goodfellas .
3 ||| while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond UNK obvious target .
1 ||| as the latest bid in the UNK franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen UNK .
3 ||| this is n't even madonna 's swept away .
3 ||| this is her blue UNK .
3 ||| the director knows how to apply UNK gloss , but his portrait of UNK is strictly sitcom .
3 ||| ... the film suffers from a lack of humor -lrb- something needed to balance out the violence -rrb- ...
3 ||| burns never really UNK to full effect the energetic cast .
3 ||| an UNK , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
3 ||| has all the depth of a UNK pool .
3 ||| this is the sort of UNK action flick where one coincidence UNK another , narrative necessity is a drunken UNK , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
1 ||| the UNK - it 's - surreal UNK -lrb- featuring the voices of UNK close , UNK UNK and breckin meyer -rrb- brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks .
3 ||| ... the movie is just a plain old monster .
1 ||| if this disposable UNK has one wild card , it 's john turturro , who 's simply UNK as a spanish butler with a foot UNK .
3 ||| one long string of cliches .
3 ||| fancy a real downer ?
3 ||| -lrb- leigh -rrb- lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .
1 ||| UNK speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
3 ||| nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly UNK spectacle .
3 ||| weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly UNK look at damaged UNK and its subtle UNK of danger .
3 ||| but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .
3 ||| at once half-baked and overheated .
3 ||| there 's a solid woman - UNK story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
1 ||| i still ca n't relate to stuart : he 's a UNK , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with UNK eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
1 ||| -lrb- serry -rrb- wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .
1 ||| it 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to UNK his ingredients is also a heavy one .
1 ||| by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , ... actually pretty good .
3 ||| of course , by more objective UNK it 's still quite bad .
1 ||| sam mendes has become UNK at the school for soft UNK and easy ways out .
3 ||| exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .
3 ||| its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
3 ||| the problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
3 ||| i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
1 ||| a UNK escape from the summer heat and the UNK doldrums that set in at this time of year .
3 ||| ... think of it as american pie on UNK .
3 ||| dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
3 ||| it 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits UNK reel .
1 ||| with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the UNK passage of its characters toward UNK , windtalkers is nothing but a UNK soap .
3 ||| some of it is clever , but it is never UNK \/
3 ||| better to just call it abc kiarostami .
1 ||| for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .
3 ||| no aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
1 ||| this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
1 ||| manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly UNK and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , UNK , uproarious .
3 ||| this rather superficial arthouse UNK film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .
1 ||| it 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this UNK destination .
3 ||| as vulgar as it is banal .
3 ||| you wonder why enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
3 ||| the film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
3 ||| the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't UNK enough for his second .
1 ||| more whiny downer than UNK commentary .
1 ||| UNK by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been UNK and UNK back to us by hollywood .
1 ||| UNK and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .
1 ||| a wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
3 ||| sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you .
3 ||| a sometimes tedious film .
3 ||| teen movies have really hit the UNK .
3 ||| there are plot holes big enough for UNK the killer whale to swim through .
1 ||| ... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a UNK but self-serious spy thriller .
3 ||| nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate UNK .
3 ||| what is 100 UNK missing here is a script of even the most elemental UNK , an UNK of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
1 ||| does paint some memorable images ... , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
3 ||| it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
3 ||| just not campy enough
3 ||| the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
3 ||| it 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .
3 ||| like watching a dress UNK the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .
3 ||| the affectionate loopiness that once seemed UNK to demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated UNK mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects .
3 ||| for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and UNK UNK that it 's enough to make one UNK for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
1 ||| american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an UNK would recognize .
3 ||| and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
3 ||| it made me want to UNK my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
1 ||| due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film UNK off into UNK .
3 ||| ... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be UNK through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on UNK UNK .
3 ||| so devoid of any kind of UNK story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful UNK
3 ||| combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest system of a down video .
3 ||| dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away .
3 ||| it 's a UNK drag .
1 ||| works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
3 ||| the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too UNK to anchor the emotional connections that UNK to span a UNK UNK .
3 ||| nonsensical , dull `` UNK '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
1 ||| instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
1 ||| manages to be both UNK sadistic and mundane .
3 ||| a great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
3 ||| there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his UNK .
1 ||| the structure the film takes may find UNK damon and ben affleck once again looking for UNK as this officially UNK a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned .
1 ||| whereas last year 's UNK sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .
3 ||| ... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the UNK cause .
1 ||| green might want to hang onto that UNK mask , as UNK may be the only way to pay for his next project .
1 ||| i can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers .
1 ||| there is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
3 ||| the tale of UNK -lrb- UNK lau -rrb- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o -lrb- takashi UNK -rrb- , the most legendary of asian UNK , is too scattershot to take hold .
3 ||| directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .
3 ||| a UNK enough but UNK forgettable rip-off of -lrb- besson 's -rrb- earlier work .
3 ||| a lackluster , UNK sequel to the classic disney adaptation of UNK barrie 's peter pan .
1 ||| samira makhmalbaf 's new film UNK is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are UNK and banal
3 ||| ... routine , harmless diversion and little else .
1 ||| late marriage 's UNK is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u.s. viewers off their feet .
1 ||| this time mr. burns is trying something in the martin scorsese UNK mode , but his UNK sentimentality UNK him up again .
1 ||| while there 's something UNK funny about UNK anthony hopkins saying ` get in the car , UNK , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
3 ||| it 's hampered by a UNK kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
3 ||| let 's hope -- UNK we ?
3 ||| there is very little dread or UNK , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
3 ||| if you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
3 ||| in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe UNK .
3 ||| adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and UNK characterized .
3 ||| but what are adults doing in the theater at all ?
1 ||| sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a UNK myopic view of life in the UNK UNK UNK undermine this adaptation .
3 ||| it 's another stale , UNK flick , complete with UNK characters and terrible , UNK dialogue .
3 ||| every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another UNK of a wrong turn .
1 ||| UNK through watching this saccharine , UNK concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show .
3 ||| the overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a UNK film for future hollywood UNK .
3 ||| UNK and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the UNK of it drama .
3 ||| a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie UNK .
1 ||| jason x is positively UNK : nine sequels and UNK years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on UNK .
3 ||| to say this was done better in wilder 's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
3 ||| at the very least , if you do n't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .
1 ||| the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .
1 ||| as ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to UNK rather than UNK character development and intelligent plotting .
3 ||| the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
3 ||| there 's no emotional pulse to solaris .
1 ||| with an emotional UNK to match its outer space setting , soderbergh 's spectacular UNK for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .
1 ||| it ca n't decide if it wants to be a UNK , a romance or a comedy .
3 ||| denis UNK 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a UNK goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .
1 ||| the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
1 ||| one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
3 ||| serving sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
3 ||| the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single UNK UNK take .
3 ||| with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a UNK endurance challenge .
3 ||| deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and UNK UNK .
3 ||| a UNK piece of UNK that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
1 ||| like the chelsea 's denizens ... UNK 's UNK scenario tends to UNK the spiritual UNK of the struggling UNK .
1 ||| it 's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt .
1 ||| the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
3 ||| another in-your-face UNK in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
3 ||| shaky close-ups of UNK , UNK UNK , UNK spots , red UNK and the filmmakers new UNK do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
3 ||| i ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
3 ||| complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
3 ||| though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay UNK and david UNK , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
1 ||| something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
3 ||| it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most UNK man who ever lived .
3 ||| on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant UNK and banality .
1 ||| the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that UNK lifelong friendships .
1 ||| offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
3 ||| makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
3 ||| the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
3 ||| although huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw UNK about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun .
1 ||| it showcases carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without UNK every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
3 ||| bad .
3 ||| very bad .
3 ||| stultifyingly , UNK , mind-numbingly bad .
1 ||| may UNK discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
1 ||| if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this imposter .
3 ||| not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need UNK thrillers .
1 ||| the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died .
3 ||| davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .
1 ||| the man from elysian fields is a cold , UNK work that UNK along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .
1 ||| the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically UNK via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale .
3 ||| determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .
1 ||| historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .
1 ||| but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
3 ||| long time dead ?
3 ||| not nearly long enough .
1 ||| nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever UNK .
3 ||| a solid film ... but more UNK than it is truly stirring .
3 ||| there 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
1 ||| the x UNK gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and UNK supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and UNK eyes , which unfortunately do n't UNK them to discern flimsy screenplays .
3 ||| perceptive in its vision of UNK UNK world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
3 ||| UNK UNK every UNK trick to give us the UNK .
1 ||| mcconaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
1 ||| an UNK amalgam of broadcast news and UNK .
1 ||| skins has a right to UNK , and we have a right to our UNK of salt .
3 ||| who needs love like this ?
3 ||| hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big UNK ' miss in the way of story .
1 ||| returning aggressively to his formula of UNK comedy and even UNK characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous UNK look smart and sassy .
1 ||| exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
3 ||| trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
1 ||| mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if UNK itself UNK profundity .
1 ||| it 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
1 ||| whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u.s. UNK , hunter -- starring irwin and his american UNK , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
1 ||| it offers little beyond the UNK joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
3 ||| a sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .
3 ||| nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
3 ||| i 'm just too bored to care .
1 ||| irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
3 ||| as UNK its title , this UNK piffle is ultimately as UNK as the UNK fabric UNK bear .
3 ||| attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
3 ||| it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong .
3 ||| nervous UNK are not entertaining .
3 ||| scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
3 ||| a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .
3 ||| like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... how can something so gross be so boring ?
3 ||| this is so bad .
3 ||| even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and UNK .
1 ||| i felt sad for UNK not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and UNK , by rohmer , for example .
1 ||| prurient UNK aside , there 's little to love about this english trifle .
1 ||| this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to UNK james bond into the mindless xxx UNK and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud UNK .
1 ||| the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent UNK .
3 ||| it 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
3 ||| the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
1 ||| van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '
1 ||| at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to UNK their lunch .
3 ||| a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep UNK and UNK .
3 ||| the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
3 ||| the end result is a film that 's neither .
3 ||| every UNK of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
3 ||| something like UNK the toilet .
1 ||| or UNK rat traps .
3 ||| or doing last year 's UNK with your UNK .
3 ||| scooby UNK doo \/ and shaggy too \/ you both look and sound great .
3 ||| \/ but UNK , you 're too buff \/ fred thinks he 's tough \/ and UNK - wow , you 've lost weight !
1 ||| is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a UNK UNK as the UNK clone ?
3 ||| there 's enough melodrama in this magnolia UNK to make UNK proud yet director muccino 's characters are less worthy of UNK than they are of daytime television .
3 ||| however it may please those who love movies that UNK with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
1 ||| the humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
3 ||| but it could have been worse .
1 ||| some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
3 ||| even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
3 ||| comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , UNK up by the UNK of a screenwriting 101 class .
1 ||| ... designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional UNK and numerous UNK .
1 ||| it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
1 ||| it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
3 ||| the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
1 ||| sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and UNK UNK chase and goldie hawn .
1 ||| schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his UNK useless movies , and it might as well be the UNK of the middle-aged character .
